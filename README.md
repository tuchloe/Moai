## Overview

"Moai" is a concept originating from Okinawa, Japan that refers to a social group of lifelong friends that can provide support in social, financial, health, or spiritual interests. This concept is strongly associated with increasing longevity through social fulfillment, especially in old age.

Moai is a social platform for seniors to make new friends online and arrange/attend social gatherings.

### Problem

The issue this application addresses is the difficulty sociailizing and meeting new people in older age, especially in an extremely multicultural city like Toronto, where most seniors are immigrants and therefore have language barriers and differences in culture, values, and social norms. Not only can it be an extremely isolating lifestyle, but social fulfilment impacts longevity as well.

### User Profile

This app is intended for seniors (approx age 60+), an age group that is known for not being technologically savvy, so in addition to a focus on web-accessibility, I will focus on making the app simple and user-friendly by minimizing the features of the app to only the essentials required to achieve the goal of the app. 

Vision Impairments:
- large text and high contrast
- simplified navigation icons
- screen reader support

Hearing Impairments:
- visual cues as well as auditory ones 

Usability for Non-Tech-Savvy Users:
- intuitive onboarding (simple sign up and optional tutorials that can be rewatched later) 

### Features

- Landing/Log in page: explains the concept of Moai and allows you to log in or create an account 
- User profiles: 
-- Name 
-- Age 
-- Location 
-- Languages 
-- Interests 
-- 1 display picture, up to 10 more
-- Religion (if applicable)
-- Ideal meeting type (dropdown)
- Search feature 
- Inbox feature 
- Notifications
- Meet someone new! Randomized profile, can filter by age, location, language, ideal meeting (dating app style)
- Location tracking, to ensure they are being matched with locals

### Auth

Does your project include any login or user profile functionality? If so, describe how authentication/authorization will be implemented.

1. Authentication (Login Functionality)

- Back-End Implementation
Technologies: Node.js, Express.js, MySQL, and bcrypt for password hashing.

User Registration:
Hash the password using bcrypt before storing it in the database.
Save user details (email, hashed password, etc.) in the MySQL database.

Login:
Verify the email and password against the stored values.
If correct, generate a JWT containing the user ID and other claims.

- Front-End Implementation
Technologies: React.js with Axios for API calls and localStorage for token management.

Login Form:
Create a form to collect email and password.
Send the credentials to the /api/auth/login endpoint using Axios

Persisting Login:
Use React Context or a global state (like Redux) to manage the login state.
Check for the JWT token in localStorage to persist the session across page reloads.

2. Authorization (Restrict Access)

- Back-End Implementation
Verify JWT Middleware:
Create a middleware function to verify the token and extract the user ID from it.
Use this middleware for routes requiring authentication

3. Secure the Application

Password Security:
Use bcrypt to hash passwords and never store them in plaintext.

Environment Variables:
Store secrets (e.g., JWT_SECRET, DB credentials) in an .env file and access them using process.env.

Token Expiry:
Set a reasonable expiration for JWT tokens (e.g., 1 hour) and refresh as needed.

HTTPS:
Ensure all communication happens over HTTPS to protect sensitive data.

## Roadmap

Scope your project as a sprint. Break down the tasks that will need to be completed and map out timeframes for implementation. Think about what you can reasonably complete before the due date. The more detail you provide, the easier it will be to build.

- Sprint 1: December 28 ‚Äì January 6
Set up the foundation for the project, including environment, database, and basic UI.

Tasks:

- Project Setup:
Initialize the repository with Git/GitHub.
Set up the project structure for full-stack development (React for front-end, Express/Node for back-end).
Install dependencies (e.g., Axios, bcrypt, JWT, React Router).

- Database Design and Setup:
Create the MySQL database schema based on the ER diagram.
Set up tables for users, profiles, and messages.
Seed the database with sample users and dummy data for testing.

- Landing/Login Page:
Design and develop the landing page (HTML, CSS, React components).
Implement the login and registration forms.

- Authentication System:
Back-end: Implement user registration, login, and JWT-based authentication.
Front-end: Connect the login form to the authentication API.


- Sprint 2: January 7 ‚Äì January 15
Build core features (profiles, matchmaking, and messaging).

Tasks:
- User Profiles:
Back-end: Create APIs to fetch, edit, and save user profiles.
Front-end: Build a profile page where users can view and edit their data.

- Meet Someone New:
Back-end: Implement API for randomized profile matching (filtered by age, location, language).
Front-end: Create a matchmaking UI (e.g., "swipe"-style or carousel-like interaction).

- Messaging System (Inbox):
Back-end: Build APIs for sending and retrieving messages between users.
Front-end: Create a basic inbox and chat UI.

- Location Tracking:
Back-end: Integrate a free geolocation API (e.g., GeoDB Cities) for user location.
Front-end: Allow users to set their location for matching purposes.

- Sprint 3: January 16 ‚Äì January 22
Refine core functionality and accessibility.

Tasks:
- UI/UX Enhancements:
Polish the landing page and all user-facing components.
Add tooltips, larger fonts, and accessible design elements for senior users.

- Error Handling:
Front-end: Display user-friendly error messages (e.g., invalid login, failed network requests).
Back-end: Add error-handling middleware to APIs.

- Sprint 4: January 23 ‚Äì January 31
Test, deploy, and document the project.

Tasks:
- Testing:
Conduct unit testing for back-end APIs.
Perform end-to-end testing on the full app.
Fix bugs and optimize performance.

- Documentation:
Write a README with setup instructions, features, and usage guide.
Document API endpoints and provide example responses for clarity.

- Final Iteration:
Gather feedback from peers or seniors (if possible).
Make last-minute fixes and tweaks.

## Nice-to-haves

- Game feature: Game(s) to play together (with friends or with random local users that they can later "add as a friend")
- Further accessibility features:
-- Ability to undo actions
-- Closed captions
-- Adjustable volume where applicable
-- "Recent activity" log of the user's actions, for seniors with weak memory
- Inbox upgrades:
-- Sending images in chat 
-- Video calling feature (friends only)
-- Search function within chat
-- within inbox: notifications via a Moai bot in inbox rather than a notification tab, this bot will have a friendly name and demeanor but the user cannot respond
- Moai inbox bots (continued): 
-- create several that are specific to the type of notification (ie, a bot to message the user when they recieve a friend request, a different bot to message the user when there is a nearby event, etc)
-- a general help AI that the user can speak with to help navigate the app
- Personal notes section under each profile 
- Events:
-- Organize/RSVP events
-- Send to specific users, or filter for area and/or language
-- Users can be notified of nearby events (if the event coordinator selected that option)
- Ability to block people, remove friends
- Ability to delete an account
- Hover over a name to pop up a mini profile synopsis:
-- Name 
-- Age 
-- Location 
-- Languages 
- Outgoing friend requests can include a message from the user
